Water Balance - following Jess Parker's spreadsheet

2018 - collected from rain gauge in front of Mathias lab by Patricia Mezza, Cara Scalpone, and Jess Shue until February 1st, then used NEON secondary tipping bucket data. Original 2018 water balance using only data collected at rain gauge results in a 24 mm greater net cumulative value than using the NEON data

2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 - NEON data from tipping bucket (SEC) from minute to daily data in mm


Barometric Pressure

Hourly data from NEON for 2020, 2021, and 2022 to match with manually downloaded data

**To Update JS**
Starting from NEON project; trouble updating the data per Rutuja's code. Created NEON_data.R using some of her code to extract precipitation and barometric pressure data from NEON.

Update current year file (2022) using code and saving the barometric pressure data directly to soil_probe on GitHub. The precipitation data is saved to Dropbox/SERC_water_balance/**year** folder. Then, add the new precipitation data to the running water balance file for the year in the soil_probe/MET_data folder.
