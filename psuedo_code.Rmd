Metadata for VanEssen TD Divers
   Six wells were installed on SERC's 16 ha ForestGEO plot in the spring of 2018 by Rutuja Chitra-Tarak, Sean McMahon, Patricia Mezza, and Cara Scalpone. Three wells were placed along two transects across an elevation gradient (9.55 m to 0.98 m). TD Divers were hung from string in each well and set to collect measurements every 5 minutes beginning May 30th 2018. The Divers record the date and time of the reading, the pressure in cm H2O, and temperature in Celsius.
   Manually downloaded files were saved to:  "~/Dropbox (Smithsonian)/watertable_package/watertable/data-raw/Diver-Office_exported data/CSV/uncompensated"
   
   In January 2019 the Divers were connected to the Sentek probe network with Roy Rich's guidance via SDI-12 boxes. The data were manually downloaded on February 4th, 2019. The sampling rate was increased to 15 minutes to improve battery life and the data first were collected by LoggerNet on February 14th 2019. The data format transmitted directly to LoggerNet changed to include the following columns:
   1 - pressure in cm H2O from diver
   2 - temperature in C from diver
   3 - barometric pressure in cm H2O from SDI-12 box
   4 - temperature in C from SDI-12 box
   5 - compensated pressure in cm H2O (column 1 - column 3)
  
  Weekly files were collected by Roy's system and saved to "~/Dropbox (Smithsonian)/FGEO_Sensor_Data/Raw_data/raw_dir"   
  
  Data were successfully collected this way until October 23, 2019 when a wire running from well 2 to well 3 was damaged (rodent). 'NA' values began appearing in the data and data were not manually downloaded again until February 27th, 2020. The Diver in well 5 also malfunctioned and was sent back to the manufacturer and replaced on (need dates).
  Data were manually downloaded roughly bi-weekly in 2020. The Divers were reconnected to the LoggerNet system around August 6, 2021 with the last manual download of data occurring on July 15, 2021.


To do:
### Manually downloaded files dates and sampling rate:
September 24, 2018 - December 31, 3018; measurement every 5 minutes
February 21, 2019; measurement every 5 minutes
March 9, 2020 - December 29, 2020; measurement every 5 minutes until files downloaded April 22nd - increased to a measurement every hour
January 19, 2021 - July 15, 2021; measurement every hour

- import data from "~/Dropbox (Smithsonian)/watertable_package/watertable/data-raw/Diver-Office_exported data/CSV/uncompensated"

- individual files for each diver with name pattern:  "serc_fgeo*.csv"  *one well is named "SERC_FGEO"

- skip header of 51 lines; column names begin on line 52 of .csv file

- these files need a barometric pressure added for compensation - either from NEON or Met Tower (remember to convert to cm H2O)

- adjust dates/sampling rate to match between NEON and Diver data

### LoggerNet files dates and sampling rates:
February 14th, 2019 - October 23rd, 2019; measurement every 15 minutes
July 29, 2021 Diver 1 only; every 15 minutes
August 6, 2021 all Divers connected; every 15 minutes

- no need to import any files after October 23rd 2019 or during 2020, the Divers were not connected to LoggerNet and all values are NA or 0

- import data from:  "~/Dropbox (Smithsonian)/FGEO_Sensor_Data/Raw_data/raw_dir"

- all diver data in one, weekly file with name pattern:  "FGEO-1_DIVER_*.dat"

- skip lines 1, 3, and 4; column names on line 2

- barometric pressure from each SDI-12 box (one at each well/diver) is the third column of data for each diver. Columns named with pattern "DIV_1_Avg_(1)", "DIV_1_Avg(2)" through "DIV_1_Avg(5)" and correspond to the column descriptions listed above

- use the Avg(1) and Avg(3) columns to compensate the cm H2O pressure




########## Added by Dominique
  
Rutuja Chitra-Tarak, Sean McMahon, and Jess Shue created three R Script files to compile and plot SERC ForestGEO plot diver data. [What distinguishes between the three separate files?] The elevation, temperature (Celsius), water pressure (H20/cm), date, and time is defined in these files. The time was adjusted for time zone and daylight savings time. 

In WaterTable_1_1, the Loggernet measured data every 15 minutes while the diver recorded every 5 minutes, so the code interpolated times to line-up time records. The difference between the observed well diver pressure and the observed atmospheric pressure was found to compensate for the atmospheric pressure from the Met Tower. This new value is known as the `water head_cmH2o` or the ground water level. The difference between the observed cable length and the pipe height surface defined the depth of the water table. Records of excess time after download and when time is not recorded was removed. Finally, elevation was corrected by negative water depth amounts. 

Lines 293-346: what is happening here?

Dominique Kelly added the barometeric pressure data for the SERC ForestGEO plot from NEON. The focus was on the barometeric pressure data collected every 30 minutes. Within this dataset, BP_mod was created to convert KPA (corPres), which was pressure corrected to sea level, to H20/cm (water pressure) collected at SERC.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
