Details of files:

watertable_28_feb_2022.csv - too large to included here; using Rutuja's code, this included all available manual data from 2018-05-09 through 2020-09-01
 - Data after September 2020 is eliminated by Rutuja's code due to missing NEON/Met Tower Barometric Pressure

ARCHIVED:
watertable_2018.csv - subset of the feb 2022 watertable file for the 2018 data only

watertable_2019.csv - subset of the feb 2022 watertable file. Will be merged with automatic data from the datalogger network as this is missing data after February 2019

watertable_2020.csv - subset of the feb 2022 watertable file. Data starts on Feb 27th, 2020 and ends August 31st, 2020. Data for diver 4c is missing entirely due to code date-time/atm. pressure subsetting issue


NEW FILES 2022:
data2018 - removed some rows of erroneous/missing data
data2019 - combined manual data from early 2019 with data from the automated network
data2020 - had to re-download some manual files as diver 3a and 6b were missing data
         - recovered some January data from the automatically downloaded data for diver 4c and adjusted timestamp
data2021 - used manually downloaded data; had to adjust 4c's timestamp again - recorded hourly
         - automated data didn't begin until August for most divers and there was some spotty/breaks in data - recorded every 15 minutes
data2022 - used manually downloaded data - hourly; 4c still needs adjusted to hourly
         - automated data had some hiccups with divers going in and out; cables were replaced and will continue to be replaced as Roy Rich has developed a better
         connection we can use as the original cable connections fail
