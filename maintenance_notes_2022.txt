2022 diver maintenance log

January 3, 2022
- snow storm caused some coarse woody debris to hit well #6; diver is fine, automatic data collection failed
- data collection prior to January was not consistent

March 4, 2022
- removed cable and diver from well #2 to use working cable to check data collection issue at well 4
- diver #2 kept in lab until and diver #4 on slightly shorter cable until March 11th, 2022
- changing cable did not help with data collection at well 4; is it the 4-pin connection on the SDI12 box causing the problem?

March 11, 2022
- returned diver #2 to the field and returned cables to correct position
- well at diver #4 felt silted when lowering the diver; plan to pump the wells soon for this year
- carefully cleaned the 4-prong connector on the SDI12 box with DI water and some ethanol
- push and then turn the cable connector onto the SDI12 box and repeat that pattern until no threads are visible
- diver #5 benefitted and data was being collected and diver #2 also started collecting data without issue
- diver #4 did not collect
- diver #1 is coming and going 

March 30, 2022
- cleaned cable at well 4 again
- downloaded data at well 6 with optical cable
- well 6 SDI12 box reconnected - wires had become loose; data from SDI12 now live; cable still not working
- emailed Van Essen about issues and received a response that my message was forwarded

June 14, 2022
- troubleshooting with VanEssen and replacement SDI12 and cables
- Firmware update was needed - Surface tablet wasn't connecting to the internet and a new version of software on my laptop showed the update was needed
- Swapped SDI12's at diver 4 and 5, but that didn't solve the issue.
- Swapped new cables at diver 4 and 5, data now collecting OK

August 2022
- Diver 2 now infrequently sending data automatically. Have attempted to re-attach cable several times without luck
- Roy Rich and techncian - Rae Tennent dropped off a re-worked cable - will replace at Diver 2 and see if that helps
- swapped cable on August 30th, now working!
