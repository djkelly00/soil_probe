2022 diver maintenance log

January 3, 2022
- snow storm caused some coarse woody debris to hit well #6; diver is fine, automatic data collection failed
- data collection prior to January was not consistent

March 4, 2022
- removed cable and diver from well #2 to use working cable to check data collection issue at well 4
- diver #2 kept in lab until and diver #4 on slightly shorter cable until March 11th, 2022
- changing cable did not help with data collection at well 4; is it the 4-pin connection on the SDI12 box causing the problem?

March 11, 2022
- returned diver #2 to the field and returned cables to correct position
- well at diver #4 felt silted when lowering the diver; plan to pump the wells soon for this year
- carefully cleaned the 4-prong connector on the SDI12 box with DI water and some ethanol
- push and then turn the cable connector onto the SDI12 box and repeat that pattern until no threads are visible
- diver #5 benefitted and data was being collected and diver #2 also started collecting data without issue
- diver #4 did not collect
- diver #1 is coming and going 

March 30, 2022
- cleaned cable at well 4 again
- downloaded data at well 6 with optical cable
- well 6 SDI12 box reconnected - wires had become loose; data from SDI12 now live; cable still not working
- emailed Van Essen about issues and received a response that my message was forwarded

May 17, 2022
- Firmware updated on diver 2, 4, 5, and 6
- Swapped new cable and SDI12 box from VanEssen at diver 5 after firmware update
- downloaded data at these wells before firmware update

May 20, 2022
- Diver 5 still not working; will swap old box and cable back in
- All other divers now sending data via network

May 25, 2022
- Swapped old SDI12 box for new box at Diver 5
- Downloaded data and updated firmware at Diver 3 and Diver 1

June 8, 2022,
- Swapped cable at well 4 with replacement from VanEssen
- Checked well 3; orange cable was loose - tightened and added more zip-ties to hold the SDI12 box in place

June 14, 2022
- troubleshooting with VanEssen and replacement SDI12 and cables
- Firmware update was needed - Surface tablet wasn't connecting to the internet and a new version of software on my laptop showed the update was needed
- Swapped SDI12's at diver 4 and 5, but that didn't solve the issue.
- Swapped new cables at diver 4 and 5, data now collecting OK

August 2022
August 30, 2022
- Replaced cable at well 2 and 4 with a rebuilt 4-pin connector made by Roy
- Diver 2 now infrequently sending data automatically. Have attempted to re-attach cable several times without luck
- Roy Rich and techncian - Rae Tennent dropped off a re-worked cable - will replace at Diver 2 and 4 and see if that helps
- swapped cable on August 30th, now working!

November 14, 2022
- Battery issue - appears power outtage may have tripped the power at the box. Attempted to reset without luck and sent SI Communications email for assistance
- Divers 3, 4, and 6 not sending data through the autmated network; all there had some evidence of water
- Downloaded data at all wells except 4; was unable to connect via the cable - water damage too great?
- Morning of November 15th all divers down except 1 and 2

November 16, 2022
- Battery level dropped below 8.7 and data no longer coming through Logger Net

November 17, 2022
- Replaced battery tender to battery
- Replaced cables at well 3, 4, 5, and 6 with rebuilt M8 connector cables

November 18, 2022
- Battery voltage up to 12.1 by 10 am using multimeter from Roy's lab
- Battery voltage up to 12.15 by 2:45 pm using same multimeter
